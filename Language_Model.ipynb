 a red pawn took a white pawn this way you see alice the chessboard is divided into sixtyfour squares red and white and the white army tries to win and the red army tries to win its like a battle   alice  with soldiers   carroll  yes here are the kings and queens they are fighting for thats the red queen and heres the white queen   alice  how funny they look   carroll  see the crowns on their heads and look at their big feet   alice  its a foot apiece thats what it is do they hump along like this   carroll  here youre spoiling the game i must keep them all in their right squares   alice  i want to be a queen   carroll  here you are he points to a small white pawn here you are in your little stiff skirt   alice  how do you do alice   carroll  and now you are going to move here   alice  let me move myself   carroll  when you have traveled all along the board this way and havent been taken by the enemy you may be a queen   alice  why do people always play with kings and queens mother has them in her playing cards too look  alice goes to the mantel and takes a pack of playing cards from the ledge  heres the king of hearts and heres his wife shes the queen of heartsisnt she crosslooking wants to bite ones head off  carroll moves a pawn  youre playing against yourself arent you   carroll  thats one way of keeping in practice alice i have friends in the university who want to beat me   alice  but if you play against yourself i should think youd want to cheat   carroll  does a nice little girl like you cheat when she plays against herself   alice  oh i never do id scold myself hard i always pretend im two people too its lots of fun isnt it sometimes when im all alone i walk up to the looking glass and talk to the other alice shes so silly that alice she cant do anything by herself she just mocks me all the time when i laugh she laughs when i point my finger at her she points her finger at me and when i stick my tongue out at her she sticks her tongue out at me kitty has a twin too havent you darling  alice goes to the mirror to show kitty her twin   carroll  ill have to write a book some day about alicealice in wonderland child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder or alice through the looking glass   alice  dont you wish sometimes you could go into lookingglass house see  alice stands on an armchair and looks into the mirror  theres the room you can see through the glass its just the same as our livingroom here only the things go the other way i can see all of itall but the bit just behind the fireplace oh i do wish i could see that bit i want so much to know if theyve a fire there you never can tell you know unless our fire smokes then smoke comes up in that room toobut that may be just to make it look as if they had a firejust to pretend they had the books are something like our books only the words go the wrong way wont there ever be any way of our getting through uncle   carroll  do you think kitty would find lookingglass milk digestible   alice  it doesnt sound awful good does it but i might leave her at home shes been into an awful lot of mischief today she found sisters knitting and chased the ball all over the garden where sister was playing croquet with the neighbors and i ran and ran after the naughty little thing until i was all out of breath and so tired i am tired  she yawns and makes herself comfortable in the armchair   carroll  replaces the playing cards on the mantel and consults his watch  take a nap yes you have time before tea   alice  half asleep  were going to have mock turtle soup for supper i heard mamma tell the cook not to pepper it too much   carroll  what a funny little rabbit it is nibbling all the time  he leans gently over the back of her chair and seeing that she is going to sleep puts out the lamp light and leaves the room a red glow from the fireplace illumines alice  dream music a bluish light reveals the red chess queen and the white chess queen in the mirror   red queen  points to alice and says in a mysterious voice  there she is lets call her over   white queen  do you think shell come   red queen  ill call softly alice   white queen  hist alice   red queen  alice   white queen  hushif she wakes and catches us   both queens  alice come through into lookingglass house  their hands beckon her   alice  rises and talks sleepily the queens disappear alice climbs from the arm of the chair to the back of another and so on up to the mantel ledge where she picks her way daintily between the vases  idontknowhowicangetthrough ive triedbeforebut the glass was hardand i was afraid of cuttingmy fingers  she feels the glass and is amazed to find it like gauze  why its soft like gauze its turning into a sort of mist why its easy to get through whywhyim going through  she disappears   scene two  is scene one reversed the portieres are black and red squares like a chessboard a soft radiance follows the characters mysteriously as the curtain rises alice comes through the looking glass steps down looks about in wonderment and goes to see if there is a fire the red queen rises out of the grate and faces her haughtily   alice  why youre the red queen   red queen  of course i am where do you come from and where are you going look up speak nicely and dont twiddle your fingers   alice  i only wanted to see what the looking glass was like perhaps ive lost my way   red queen  i dont know what you mean by your way all the ways about here belong to me curtsey while youre thinking what to say it saves time   alice  ill try it when i go home the next time im a little late for dinner   red queen  its time for you to answer now open your mouth a little wider when you speak and always say your majesty i suppose you dont want to lose your name   alice  no indeed   red queen  and yet i dont know only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it for instance if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons she would call out come here and there she would have to leave off because there wouldnt be any name for her to call and of course you wouldnt have to go you know   alice  that would never do im sure the governess would never think of excusing me from lessons for that if she couldnt remember my name shed call me miss as the servants do   red queen  well if she said miss and didnt say anything more of course youd miss your lessons i dare say you cant even read this book   alice  its all in some language i dont know why its a lookingglass book of course and if i hold it up to a glass the words will all go the right way again    jabberwocky    twas brillig and the slithy toves     did gyre and gimble in the wabe   all mimsy were the borogoves     and the mome raths outgrabe  it seems very pretty but its rather hard to understand somehow it seems to fill my head with ideasonly i dont exactly know what they are   red queen  i daresay you dont know your geography either look at the map  she takes a right angle course to the portieres and points to them with her sceptre   alice  its marked out just like a big chessboard i wouldnt mind being a pawn though of course i should like to be a red queen best   red queen  thats easily managed when you get to the eighth square youll be a queen its a huge game of chess thats being playedall over the world come on weve got to run faster dont try to talk   alice  i cant   red queen  faster faster   alice  are we nearly there   red queen  nearly there why we passed it ten minutes ago faster you may rest a little now   alice  why i do believe were in the same place everythings just as it was   illustration   red queen  of course it is what would you have it   alice  well in our country youd generally get to somewhere elseif you ran very fast for a long time as weve been doing   red queen  a slow sort of country now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place if you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that   alice  id rather not try please im quite content to stay hereonly i am so hot and thirsty   red queen  i know what youd like  she takes a little box out of her pocket  have a biscuit  alice not liking to refuse curtseys as she takes the biscuit and chokes   red queen  while youre refreshing yourself ill just take the measurements  she takes a ribbon out of her pocket and measures the map with it  at the end of two yards i shall give you your directionshave another biscuit   alice  no thank you ones quite enough   red queen  thirst quenched i hope at the end of three yards i shall repeat themfor fear of your forgetting them at the end of four i shall say goodbye and at the end of five i shall go that square belongs to humpty dumpty and that square to the gryphon and mock turtle and that square to the queen of hearts but you make no remark   alice  ii didnt know i had to make onejust then   red queen  you should have said its extremely kind of you to tell me all this however well suppose it said four goodbye five  red queen vanishes in a gust of wind behind the portieres rabbit music white rabbit comes out of the fireplace and walks about the room hurriedly he wears a checked coat carries white kid gloves in one hand a fan in the other and takes out his watch to look at it anxiously   white rabbit  oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting   alice  ive never seen a rabbit with a waistcoat and a watch and a waistcoat pocket if you please sir   white rabbit  oh  he drops fan and gloves in fright and dashes out by way of the portieres in a gust of wind alice picks up the fan and playfully puts on the gloves the portieres flap in the breeze and a shawl flies in   alice  catches the shawl and looks about for the owner then meets the white queen  im very glad i happened to be in the way   white queen  runs in wildly both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying and cries in a helpless frightened way  breadandbutter breadandbutter   alice  am i addressing the white queen   white queen  well yes if you call that adressing it isnt my notion of the thing at all   alice  if your majesty will only tell me the right way to begin ill do it as well as i can   white queen  but i dont want it done at all ive been adressing myself for the last two hours   alice  every single things crooked and youre all over pins may i put your shawl straight for you   white queen  i dont know whats the matter with it its out of temper ive pinned it here and ive pinned it there but theres no pleasing it   alice  it cant go straight you know if you pin it all on one side and dear me what a state your hair is in   white queen  the brush has got entangled in it and i lost the comb yesterday   alice  takes out the brush and arranges the queens hair  you look better now but really you should have a ladys maid   white queen  im sure ill take you with pleasure two pence a week and jam every other day   alice  who cannot help laughing  i dont want you to hire meand i dont care for jam   white queen  its very good jam   alice  well i dont want any today at any rate   white queen  you couldnt have it if you did want it the rule is jam tomorrow and jam yesterdaybut never jam today   alice  it must come sometimes to jam today   white queen  no it cant its jam every other day today isnt any other day you know   alice  i dont understand you its dreadfully confusing   white queen  thats the effect of living backwards it always makes one a little giddy at first   alice  living backwards i never heard of such a thing   white queen  but theres one great advantage in itthat ones memory works both ways   alice  im sure mine only works one way i cant remember things before they happen   white queen  its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards   alice  what sort of things do you remember best   white queen  oh things that happened the week after next for instance now  she sticks a large piece of plaster on her finger  theres the kings messengerhes in prison being punished and the trial doesnt even begin till next wednesday and of course the crime comes last of all   alice  suppose he never commits the crime   white queen  binding the plaster with ribbon  that would be all the better wouldnt it   alice  of course it would be all the better but it wouldnt be all the better his being punished   white queen  youre wrong there at any rate were you ever punished   alice  only for faults   white queen  and you were all the better for it i know   alice  yes but then i had done the things i was punished for that makes all the difference   white queen  but if you hadnt done them that would have been better still better and better and better   alice  theres a mistake somewhere   white queen  screams like an engine whistle and shakes her hand  oh oh oh my fingers bleeding oh oh oh   alice  what is the matter have you pricked your finger   white queen  i havent pricked it yetbut i soon shalloh oh oh   alice  when do you expect to do it   white queen  when i fasten my shawl again the brooch will come undone directly oh oh  brooch flies open and she clutches it wildly   alice  take care youre holding it all crooked   white queen  pricks her finger and smiles  that accounts for the bleeding you see now you understand the way things happen here   alice  but why dont you scream now   illustration   white queen  why ive done all the screaming already what would be the good of having it all over again oh its time to run if you want to stay in the same place come on   alice  no no not so fast im getting dizzy   white queen  faster faster   alice  everythings black before my eyes  there is music and the sound of rushing wind and in the darkness the white queen cries faster faster alice gasps i cantplease stop and the queen replies then you cant stay in the same place ill have to drop you behind fasterfaster goodbye   scene three  when the curtain rises one sees nothing but odd black lanterns with orange lights hanging presumably from the sky the scene lights up slowly revealing alice seated on two large cushions she has been dropped behind by the white queen and is dazed to find herself in a strange hall with many peculiar doors and knobs too high to reach   alice  oh my head where am i oh dear oh dear  she staggers up and to her amazement finds herself smaller than the table  ive never been smaller than any table before ive always been able to reach the knobs what a curious feeling oh im shrinking its the fanthe gloves  she throws them away feels her head and measures herself against table and doors  oh saved in time but i nevernever   white rabbit  oh my fan and gloves where are my   alice  oh mr rabbitplease help me outi want to go homei want to go home   white rabbit  oh the duchess oh my fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets oh you have them   alice  im sorryyou dropped them you know   white rabbit  picks up fan and gloves and patters off  shell chop off your head   alice  if you please sirwhere am iwont you pleasetell me how to get outi want to get out   white rabbit  looking at his watch  oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting  a trap door gives way and rabbit disappears alice dashes after only in time to have the trap door bang in her face   alice  amazed  its a rabbitholeim small enough to fit it too if i shrink any more it might end in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i would be like then what does the flame of a candle look like after the candle is blown out ive never seen such a thing   humpty dumpty  sits on the wall  dont stand chattering to yourself like that but tell me your name and your business   alice  my name is alice but   humpty dumpty  its a stupid name enough what does it mean   alice  must a name mean something   humpty dumpty  of course it must my name means the shape i amand a good handsome shape it is too with a name like yours you might be any shape almost   alice  youre humpty dumpty just like an egg   humpty dumpty  its very provoking to be called an eggvery   alice  i said you looked like an egg sir and some eggs are very pretty you know   humpty dumpty  some people have no more sense than a baby   alice  why do you sit here all alone   humpty dumpty  why because theres nobody with me did you think i didnt know the answer to that ask another   alice  dont you think youd be safer down on the ground that walls so very narrow   humpty dumpty  what tremendously easy riddles you ask of course i dont think so take a good look at me im one that has spoken to a king i am to show you im not proud you may shake hands with me  he leans forward to offer alice his hand but she is too small to reach it  however this conversation is going on a little too fast lets go back to the last remark but one   alice  im afraid i cant remember it   humpty dumpty  in that case we start fresh and its my turn to choose a subject   alice  you talk about it just as if it were a game   humpty dumpty  so heres a question for you how old did you say you were   alice  seven years and six months   humpty dumpty  wrong you never said a word about it now if youd asked my advice id have said leave off at sevenbut   alice  i never ask advice about growing   humpty dumpty  too proud   alice  what a beautiful belt youve got on at least a beautiful cravat i should have saidno a belt i meani beg your pardon if only i knew which was neck and which was waist   humpty dumpty  it is amostprovokingthing when a person doesnt know a cravat from a belt   alice  i know its very ignorant of me   humpty dumpty  its a cravat child and a beautiful one as you say theres glory for you   alice  i dont know what you mean by glory   humpty dumpty  when i use a word it means just what i choose it to meanneither more nor less   alice  the question is whether you can make words mean different things   humpty dumpty  the question is which is to be masterthats all impenetrability thats what i say   alice  would you tell me please what that means   humpty dumpty  i meant by impenetrability that weve had enough of that subject and it would be just as well if youd mention what you mean to do next as i suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest of your life   alice  thats a great deal to make one word mean   humpty dumpty  when i make a word do a lot of work like that i always pay it extra   alice  oh   humpty dumpty  ah you should see em come round me of a saturday night for to get their wages you know thats allgoodbye   alice  goodbye till we meet again   humpty dumpty  i shouldnt know you again if we did meet youre so exactly like other people   alice  the face is what one goes by generally   humpty dumpty  thats just what i complain of your face is the same as everybody hasthe two eyessonose in the middle mouth under its always the same now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose for instanceor the mouth at the topthat would be some help   alice  it wouldnt look nice   humpty dumpty  wait till youve tried goodbye  he disappears as he came   alice  oh i forgot to ask him how to  she tries to open the doors they are all locked she begins to weep she walks weeping to a high glass table and sits down on its lower ledge she sits on a big golden key and picks it up in surprise she tries it on all the doors but it does not fit she weeps and weepsand wonderland grows dark to her in her despair in the darkness she cries oh im slipping oh oh its a lake oh my tears im floating a mysterious light shows a drink me sign around a bottle on the top of the table alice floats up to it panting and holding on to the edge of the table takes up the bottle   alice  it isnt marked poison  she sips at it  this is good tastes like cherry tart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and hot buttered toastall together oh oh im letting out like a telescope  a mysterious light shows her lengthening out  music  but the lake is rising too oh oh its deep im drowning help help im drowning im drowning in my tears   gryphon  hjckrrh hjckrrh  the gryphon a huge green creature with big glittering wings appears where humpty dumpty had been and reaches glittering claws over to grab and save alice   scene four  is symbolic of a wet and rocky shore in a weird green light the mock turtle is weeping dismally   gryphon  hjckrrh hjckrrh hjckrrh   mock turtle  answers with his weeping   gryphon  drags alice in  drop your tears into the sea with his   alice  he sobs as if he had a bone in his throat he sighs as if his heart would break what is his sorrow   mock turtle  oh gryphon its terrible   gryphon  its all his fancy that mock turtle hasnt got no sorrow this here young lady she wants for to know your history she do   mock turtle  ill tell it her sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished   alice  i dont see how you can ever finish if you dont begin   mock turtle  once i was a real turtle  a long silence is broken only by the exclamations hjckrrh of the gryphon and the heavy sobbing of the mock turtle   mock turtle  when we were little we went to school in the sea the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoise   alice  why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one   mock turtle  we called him tortoise because he taught us really you are very dull   gryphon  you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question drive on old fellow dont be all day about it   mock turtle  yes we went to school in the sea tho you maynt believe it   alice  i never said i didnt   mock turtle  you did   gryphon  hold your tongue   mock turtle  we had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day   alice  ive been to a day school too you neednt be so proud as all that   mock turtle  with extras   alice  yes we learned french and music   mock turtle  and washing   alice  certainly not   illustration   mock turtle  ah then yours wasnt a really good school now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washingextra   alice  you couldnt have wanted it much living at the bottom of the sea   mock turtle  i couldnt afford to learn it i only took the regular course   alice  what was that   mock turtle  reeling and writhing of course to begin with and then the different branches of arithmeticambition distraction uglification and derision   alice  i never heard of uglification what is it   gryphon  never heard of uglifying you know what to beautify is i suppose   alice  yes it meanstomakeanythingprettier   gryphon  well then if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton   alice  what else had you to learn   mock turtle  well there was mystery mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old conger eel that used to come once a week what he taught us was drawling stretching and fainting in coils   alice  what was that like   mock turtle  well i cant show it you myself im too stiff and the gryphon never learned it   gryphon  hadnt time i went to the classical master though he was an old crab he was   mock turtle  i never went to him he taught laughing and grief they used to say   gryphon  so he did so he did   alice  and how many hours a day did you do lessons   mock turtle  ten hours the first day nine the next and so on   alice  what a curious plan   gryphon  thats the reason theyre called lessons because they lessen from day to day   alice  then the eleventh day must have been a holiday   mock turtle  of course it was   alice  and how did you manage on the twelfth   gryphon  thats enough about lessons tell her something about the games now  mock turtle sighs deeply draws back of one flapper across his eyes he looks at alice and tries to speak but sobs choke his voice   gryphon  punching him in the back  same as if he had a bone in his throat   mock turtle  with tears running down his cheeks  you may not have lived much under the sea   alice  i havent   mock turtle  and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster   alice  i once tastedno never   mock turtle  so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is   alice  no indeed what sort of a dance is it   gryphon  why you first form into a line along the seashore   mock turtle  two lines seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way   gryphon  that generally takes some time   mock turtle  you advance twice   gryphon  each with a lobster as a partner   mock turtle  of course advance twice set to partners   gryphon  change lobsters and retire in same order   mock turtle  then you know you throw the   gryphon  the lobsters   mock turtle  as far out to sea as you can   gryphon  swim after them   mock turtle  turn a somersault in the sea   gryphon  change lobsters again   mock turtle  back to land again andthats all the first figure   alice  it must be a very pretty dance   mock turtle  would you like to see a little of it   alice  very much indeed   mock turtle  come lets try the first figure we can do it without lobsters you know which shall sing   gryphon  oh you sing ive forgotten the words  creatures solemnly dance round and round alice treading on her toes waving forepaws to mark time while mock turtle sings    first verse    will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail   theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail   see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance   they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance   will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance   will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance    second verse    you can really have no notion how delightful it will be   when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea   but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance   said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance   would not could not would not could not would not join the dance   would not could not would not could not could not join the dance  the creatures dance against alice pushing her back and forth between them she protests and finally escapes they bump against each other   alice  thank you its a very interesting dance to watch and i do so like that curious song about the whiting   mock turtle  oh as to the whiting theyyouve seen them of course   alice  yes ive often seen them at din  checks herself hastily   mock turtle  i dont know where din may be but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like   alice  i believe so they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs   mock turtle  youre wrong about the crumbs crumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is  mock turtle yawns and shuts his eyes  tell her about the reason and all that   gryphon  the reason is that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats all   alice  thank you its very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting before   gryphon  i can tell you more than that if you like do you know why its called a whiting   alice  i never thought about it why   gryphon  it does the boots and shoes   alice  does the boots and shoes   gryphon  why what are your shoes done with i mean what makes them so shiny   alice  theyre done with blacking i believe   gryphon  boots and shoes under the sea are done with whiting now you know   alice  and what are they made of   gryphon  soles and eels of course any shrimp could have told you that   alice  if id been the whiting id have said to the porpoise keep back please we dont want you with us   mock turtle  they were obliged to have him with them no wise fish would go anywhere

curtain rises to reveal small silhouettes of the gryphon mock turtle and alice in an orangecolored moon far away in the sky down below the white rabbit is shouting to them youll be safe in the march hares garden  curtain     act ii   scene  the march hares garden showing part of the duchess house on a small platform there is a tea table set with many cups continuing into wings to give impression of limitless length the march hare hatter and dormouse are crowded at one end alice sits on the ground where she has been dropped from the sky finding herself not bruised she rises and approaches the table   march hare and hatter  no room no room   alice  theres plenty of room  she sits in a large armchair at one end of the table  i dont know who you are   march hare  i am the march hare thats the hatter and this is the dormouse have some wine   alice  i dont see any wine   march hare  there isnt any   alice  then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it   march hare  it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited   alice  i didnt know it was your table its laid for a great many more than three   hatter  your hair wants cutting   alice  you should learn not to make personal remarks its very rude   hatter  why is a raven like a writingdesk   alice  come we shall have some fun now im glad youve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that   march hare  so you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it   illustration hatter your hair wants cutting   alice  exactly so   march hare  then you should say what you mean   alice  i do at leastat least i mean what i saythats the same thing you know   hatter  not the same thing a bit why you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see   march hare  you might just as well say that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like   dormouse  you might just as well say that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe   hatter  it is the same thing with you  takes out his watch looks at it uneasily shakes it holds it to his ear  what day of the month is it   alice  the fourth   hatter  two days wrong i told you butter wouldnt suit the works   march hare  it was the best butter   hatter  yes but some crumbs must have got in as well you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife   march hare  takes the watch looks at it gloomily dips it into his cup of tea and looks at it again but doesnt know what else to say  it was the best butter you know   alice  what a funny watch it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is   hatter  why should it does your watch tell you what year it is   alice  of course not but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time together   hatter  which is just the case with mine   alice  i dont quite understand you what you said had no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english   hatter  pouring some hot tea on the dormouses nose  the dormouse is asleep again   dormouse  of course of course just what i was going to remark myself   hatter  have you guessed the riddle yet   alice  no i give it up whats the answer   hatter  i havent the slightest idea   march hare  nor i   alice  i think you might do something better with the time than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers   hatter  if you knew time as well as i do you wouldnt talk about wasting it its him   alice  i dont know what you mean   hatter  of course you dont i dare say you never even spoke to time   alice  perhaps not but i know i have to beat time when i learn music   hatter  ah that accounts for it he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling half past one time for dinner   march hare  i only wish it was   alice  that would be grand certainly but theni shouldnt be hungry for it you know   hatter  not at first perhaps but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked   alice  is that the way you manage   hatter  not i we quarreled last marchjust before he went mad you know it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing    twinkle twinkle little bat   how i wonder what youre at  you know the song perhaps   alice  ive heard something like it   dormouse  twinkle twinkle twinkle   hatter  well id hardly finished the first verse when the queen bawled out hes murdering the time off with his head   alice  how dreadfully savage   hatter  and ever since that he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now   alice  is that the reason so many tea things are put out here   hatter  yes thats it its always tea time and weve no time to wash the things between whiles   alice  then you keep moving round i suppose   hatter  exactly so as the things get used up   alice  but when you come to the beginning again   march hare  suppose we change the subject i vote the young lady tells us a story   alice  im afraid i dont know one   march hare and hatter  then the dormouse shall wake up dormouse  they pinch him on both sides at once   dormouse  opens his eyes slowly and says in a hoarse feeble voice  i wasnt asleep i heard every word you fellows were saying   march hare  tell us a story   alice  yes please do   hatter  and be quick about it or youll be asleep again before its done   dormouse  once upon a time there were three little sisters and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well   alice  what did they live on   illustration   dormouse  they lived on treacle   alice  they couldnt have done that you know theyd have been ill   dormouse  so they were very ill   alice  but why did they live at the bottom of a well   march hare  take some more tea   alice  ive had nothing yet so i cant take more   hatter  you mean you cant take less its very easy to take more than nothing   alice  nobody asked your opinion   hatter  whos making personal remarks now   alice  helps herself to tea and bread and butter  why did they live at the bottom of a well   dormouse  takes a minute or two to think  it was a treaclewell   alice  theres no such thing   hatter and march hare  sh sh   dormouse  if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself   alice  very humbly  no please go on i wont interrupt you again i dare say there may be one   dormouse  one indeed and so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw you know   alice  what did they draw   dormouse  treacle   hatter  i want a clean cup lets all move one place on  hatter moves on dormouse takes his place march hare takes dormouses place and alice unwillingly takes march hares place   alice  im worse off than i was before youve upset the milk jug into your plate   march hare  it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited   alice  where did they draw the treacle from   hatter  you can draw water out of a water well so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle welleh stupid   alice  but they were in the well   dormouse  of course they werewell in they were learning to draw and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an m   alice  why with an m   illustration   march hare  why not  alice is silent and confused hatter pinches dormouse to wake him up   dormouse  wakes with a little shriek and continues  that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness   hatter  did you   alice  really now you ask me i dont think   hatter  then you shouldnt talk   march hare  no   alice  rises and walks away  you are very rude its the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life  white rabbit enters carrying a huge envelope with a seal and crown on it   march hare and hatter  no room no room  rabbit pays no attention to them but goes to the house and raps loudly a footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and powdered hair opens the door   white rabbit  for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet   frog  from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet  white rabbit bows and goes out   march hare and hatter  to white rabbit  no room no room no room  the frog disappears into the house but leaves the door open there is a terrible din and many sauce pans fly out   march hare  shes at it again   hatter  its perfectly disgusting   march hare  lets move on  the platform moves off with table chairs march hare hatter and dormouse meanwhile the frog has come out again and is sitting near the closed door staring stupidly at the sky alice goes to the door timidly and knocks   frog  theres no sort of use in knocking and that for two reasons first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you   alice  please then how am i to get in   frog  there might be some sense in your knocking if we had the door between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know   alice  how am i to get in   frog  i shall sit here till tomorrow  the door opens and a large plate skims out straight at the frogs head it grazes his nose and breaks into pieces  frog acts as if nothing had happened  or next day maybe   alice  how am i to get in   frog  are you to get in at all thats the first question you know   alice  its really dreadful the way all you creatures argue its enough to drive one crazy   frog  i shall sit here on and off for days and days   alice  but what am i to do   frog  anything you like  he begins to whistle   alice  wheres the servant whose business it is to answer the door   frog  which door   alice  this door of course   illustration frog i shall sit here till tomorrow   the frog looks at the door and rubs his thumb on it to see if the paint will come off  illustration   frog  to answer the door whats it been asking for   alice  i dont know what you

and alice sneezes   duchess  if everybody minded her own business  she sneezes   alice  its pepper   duchess  of course my cook puts it in the soup   alice  theres certainly too much pepper in the soup   duchess  sneeze then and get rid of it  duchess begins to sing to the baby giving it a violent shake at the end of every line of the lullaby    speak roughly to your little boy     and beat him when he sneezes  frog and alice sneeze    he only does it to annoy     because he knows it teases  duchess sneezes frog sneezes alice sneezes    i speak severely to my boy     i beat him when he sneezes  frog sneezes alice sneezes    for he can thoroughly enjoy     the pepper when he pleases  duchess sneezes frog sneezes alice sneezes duchess gasps and gives a tremendous sneeze   alice  oh dear  she jumps aside as kettles and pots come flying out of the door the duchess pays no attention  what a cook to have  she calls inside  oh please mind what youre doing  another pan comes out and almost hits the baby  oh there goes his precious nose   duchess  if everybody minded her own business the world would go round a deal faster than it does   alice  which would not be an advantage just think what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis   duchess  talking of axes chop off her head  the head of a grinning cheshire cat appears in a tree above a wall   alice  oh whats that   duchess  cat of course   alice  why does it grin like that   duchess  its a cheshire cat and thats why to baby pig   illustration duchess i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes   alice  i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grin   duchess  they all can and most of em do   alice  i dont know of any that do   duchess  you dont know much and thats a fact here you may nurse it a bit if you like  flings the baby at alice  i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen  she goes into the house   alice  if i dont take this child away with me theyre sure to kill it in a day or two cheshire puss would you tell me please which way i ought to walk from here   cat  that depends a good deal on where you want to get to   alice  i dont much care where   cat  then it doesnt matter which way you walk   alice  so long as i get somewhere   cat  oh youre sure to do that if you only walk long enough   alice  please will you tell me what sort of people live about here   cat  all mad people   alice  but i dont want to go among mad people   cat  oh you cant help that were all mad here im mad hes mad hes dreaming now and what do you think hes dreaming about   alice  goes to the frog to scrutinize his face  nobody could guess that   cat  why about you and if he left off dreaming about you where do you suppose youd be   alice  where i am now of course   cat  not you youd be nowhere why youre only a sort of thing in his dream and youre mad too   alice  how do you know

heavy and so ugly dont gruntohohits apig please mr footman take it   frog  rises with dignity whistles and disappears into the house a kettle comes bounding out alice puts pig down and it crawls off   cat  appearing again  bythebye what became of the baby   alice  it turned into a pig   cat  i thought it would  vanishes  frog comes out of the house with hedgehogs and flamingoes   cat  reappearing  did you say pig or fig   alice  i said pig and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy   cat  all right it vanishes slowly  frog puts flamingoes down and reenters house while alice is examining the flamingoes curiously tweedledum and tweedledee each with an arm round the others neck sidestep in and stand looking at alice   alice  turns sees them starts in surprise and involuntarily whispers  tweedledee   dum  dum   dee  if you think were waxworks you ought to pay   dum  contrariwise if you think were alive you ought to speak   dee  the first thing in a visit is to say how dye do and shake hands  the brothers give each other a hug then hold out the two hands that are free to shake hands with her alice does not like shaking hands with either of them first for fear of hurting the other ones feelings she takes hold of both hands at once and they all dance round in a ring quite naturally to music here we go round the mulberry bush   alice  would you tell me which road leads out of   dee  what shall i repeat to her   dum  the walrus and the carpenter is the longest  gives his brother an affectionate hug   dee    the sun was shining   alice  if its very long would you please tell me first which road   dee    the moon was shining sulkily  dum    the sea was wet as wet could be   dee    o oysters come and walk with us     the walrus did beseech   dum  looks at dee    a pleasant walk a pleasant talk     along the briny beach   dee  looks at dum    the eldest oyster winked his eye     and shook his heavy head   dum  looks at dee    meaning to say he did not choose     to leave the oyster bed   dee    but four young oysters hurried up     and yet another four   dum    and thick and fast they came at last     and more and more and more   dee    the walrus and the carpenter     walked on a mile or so   dum    and then they rested on a rock     conveniently low   dee    and all the little oysters stood     and waited in a row

dee    it seems a shame the walrus said     to play them such a trick   after weve brought them out so far     and made them trot so quick   dum    o oysters said the carpenter     youve had a pleasant run   dee    shall we be trotting home again   dum    but answer came there none   dee    and this was scarcely odd because   dum    theyd eaten every   dee  interrupts in a passion pointing to a white rattle on the ground  do you see that   alice  its only a rattle   dum  stamps wildly and tears his hair  i knew it was its spoilt of course my nice new rattle  to dee  you agree to have a battle  he collects sauce pans and pots   dee  picks up a sauce pan  i suppose so lets fight till dinner  they go out hand in hand   alice  hears music  i wonder what is going to happen next  she backs down stage respectfully as the king and queen of hearts enter followed by the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and the white rabbit and others when they come opposite to alice they stop and look at her  the duchess comes out of her house   queen  to the knave  who is this   illustration   knave  bows three times smiles and giggles   queen  idiot whats your name child   alice  my name is alice so please your majesty   queen  off with her head off   alice  nonsense   king  consider my dear she is only a child   queen  can you play croquet   alice  yes   queen  come on then get to your places where are the mallets   duchess  here  the frog appears with the flamingoes and hedgehogs   queen  off with his head  no one pays any attention   knave  what fun   alice  what is the fun   knave  why she its all her fancy that they never execute anyone   alice  what does one do   queen  get to your places  she takes a flamingo uses its neck as a mallet and a hedgehog as a ball the frog doubles himself into an arch the king does the same with the followers and the knave offers himself as an arch for alice even though alice does not notice him he holds the arch position the queen shouts at intervals off with his head off with her head   alice  where are the chess queens   rabbit  under sentence of execution   alice  what for   rabbit  did you say what a pity   alice  no i didnt i dont think its at all a pity i said what for   rabbit  they boxed the queens ears  alice gives a little scream of laughter   rabbit  oh hush the queen will hear you you see they came rather late and the queen saidoh dear the queen hears me  he hurries away   alice  noticing the knave who still pretends to be an arch  how can you go on thinking so quietly with your head downwards   knave  what does it matter where my body happens to be my mind goes on working just the same the fact of it is the more head downwards i am the more i keep on inventing new things   king  did you happen to meet any soldiers my dear as you came through the wood   alice  yes i did several thousand i should think   king  four thousand two hundred and seven thats the exact number they couldnt send all the horses you know because two of them are wanted in the game and i havent sent the two messengers either   alice  whats the war about   king  the red chess king has the whole army against us but he cant kill a man who has thirteen hearts  the duchess queen frog and followers go out the knave and the fivespot sevenspot and ninespot of hearts stand behind the king   illustration king i only wish i had such eyes to be able to see nobody   king  just look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my messengers   alice  i see nobody on the road   king  i only wish i had such eyes to be able to see nobody and at that distance too why its as much as i can do to see real people by this light   alice  i see somebody now but hes coming very slowlyand what curious attitudes he goes intoskipping up and down and wriggling like an eel   king  not at all those are anglosaxon attitudes he only does them when hes happy i must have two messengers you knowto come and go one to come and one to go   alice  i beg your pardon   king  it isnt respectable to beg   alice  i only meant that i didnt understand why one to come and one to go   king  dont i tell you i must have twoto fetch and carry one to fetch and one to carry   march hare  enters pants for breathwaves his hands about and makes fearful faces at the king   king  you alarm me i feel faintgive me a ham sandwich another sandwich   march hare  theres nothing but hay left now   king  hay then theres nothing like eating hay when youre faint   alice  i should think throwing cold water over you would be better   king  i didnt say there was nothing better i said there was nothing like it   king  who did you pass on the road   march hare  nobody   king  quite right this young lady saw him too so of course nobody walks slower than you   march hare  i do my best im sure nobody walks much faster than i do   king  he cant do that or else hed have been here first however now youve got your breath you may tell us whats happened in the town   march hare  ill whisper it  much to alices surprise he shouts into the kings ear  theyre at it again   king  do you call that a whisper if you do such a thing again ill have you buttered it went through and through my head like an earthquake give me details quick  the king and march hare go out followed by five seven and nine spots   duchess  runs in and tucks her arm affectionately into alices  you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing   alice  oh   duchess  youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit   alice  perhaps it hasnt one   duchess  tut tut child everythings got a moral if only you can find it  squeezes closely digs her chin into alices shoulder and roughly drags alice along for a walk   alice  the games going on rather better now   duchess  tis so and the moral of that isoh tis love tis love that makes the world go round   alice  somebody said that its done by everybody minding their own business   duchess  ah well it means much the same thing and the moral of that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves   alice  how fond you are of finding morals in things   duchess  i daresay youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment   alice  he might bite   duchess  very true flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that isbirds of a feather flock together   alice  only mustard isnt a bird   duchess  right as usual what a clear way you have of putting things   alice  its a mineral i think   duchess  of course it is theres a large mustard mine near here and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of yours   alice  oh i know its a vegetable it doesnt look like one but it is   duchess  i quite agree with you and the moral of that isbe what you would seem to be or if youd like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise   alice  i think i should understand that better if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it   duchess  thats nothing to what i could say if i chose   alice  pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that   duchess  oh dont talk about trouble i make you a present of everything ive said as yet   alice  uhm   duchess  thinking again   alice  ive got a right to think   duchess  just about as much right as pigs have to fly and the moral  the arm of the duchess begins to tremble and her voice dies down the queen of hearts stands before them with folded arms and frowning like a thunderstorm   duchess  a fine day your majesty   queen  now i give you fair warning either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice  the duchess goes meekly into the house   illustration   queen  lets go on with the game  she goes off and shouts at intervals off with his head off with her head   cat  how are you getting on   alice  its no use speaking to you till your ears have come i dont think they play at all fairly and they all quarrel so and they dont seem to have any rules in particular and youve no idea how confusing it is with all the things alive theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming  music begins   cat  how do you like the queen   alice  not at all shes so extremely  the king queen and entire court enter the queen is near to alice the music stops and all look at alice questioningly  alice tries to propitiate the queen  likely to win  music continues  that its hardly worth while finishing the game  queen smiles and passes on   king  who are you talking to   alice  its a friend of minea cheshire catallow me to introduce it   king  i dont like the look of it at all however it may kiss my hand if it likes   cat  id rather not   king  dont be impertinent and dont look at me like that   alice  a cat may look at a king ive read that in some book but i dont remember where   king  well it must be removed my dear i wish you would have this cat removed   queen  off with his head   knave  but you cant cut off a head unless theres a body to cut it off from   king  anything that has a head can be beheaded   queen  if something isnt done about it in less than no time ill have everybody executed all round   alice  it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about it   duchess  its a lie   cat  youd better ask me do it if you can  it grins away the duchess and frog escape into the house   queen  cut it off   king  its gone   everybody  its gone its gone where where where   queen  cut it off cut them all off   everybody  no no no   alice  save me save me   knave  shouts to alice and gives her a tart for safety  take a tart   queen  seeing alice stand out a moment from the others  cut hers off cut hers off   others  glad to distract queens attention from themselves  cut hers off cut hers off cut   alice  cries in fear and takes a quick bite at the tart if there is a trap door on the stage alice disappears down it leaving the crowd circling around the hole screaming and amazed if the stage has no trap door a bridge is built across the footlights with stairs leading down into the orchestra pit when the crowd is chasing alice she jumps over the footlights onto the bridge and as the curtain is falling dividing her from the crowd she appeals to the audience save me save me who will save me and runs down the stairs and disappears  curtain     act iii   scene one  is a garden of high very conventional and artificial looking flowers on a large mushroom sits the caterpillar smoking a hookah alice is whirling about trying to get her equilibrium after her fall she goes to the mushroom timidly and conscious of her size for her chin reaches the top of the mushroom she gazes at the caterpillar wonderingly he looks at her lazily and speaks in a languid voice   caterpillar  who are you   alice  ii hardly know sir just at present the queen frightened me so and ive had an awfully funny fall down a tunnel or a sort of well at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then   caterpillar  what do you mean by that explain yourself   alice  i cant explain myself im afraid sir because im not myself you see being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing   illustration   caterpillar  you who are you   alice  i think you ought to tell me who you are first   caterpillar  why  as alice turns away  come back ive something important to say  alice comes back  keep your temper   alice  is that all   caterpillar  no  he puffs at the hookah in silence finally takes it out of his mouth and unfolds his arms  so you think youre changed do you   alice  im afraid i am sir i dont keep the same size   caterpillar  what size do you want to be   alice  i dont know at least ive never been so small as a caterpillar   caterpillar  rears angrily  it is a very good height indeed   alice  but im not used to it i wish you wouldnt all be so easily offended   caterpillar  youll get used to it in time   alice  are you too big or am i too small  she compares her height wonderingly with the tall flowers   caterpillar  looks at her sleepily yawns shakes himself slides down from the mushroom and crawls slowly away  one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter   alice  one side of what the other side of what   caterpillar  of the mushroom  alice hesitates then embraces mushroom and picks bit from each side  three gardeners representing spades enter carrying brushes and red paint cans   twospot  look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like that   fivespot  i couldnt help it seven jogged my elbow   sevenspot  thats right five always lay the blame on others   fivespot  youd better not talk i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded   twospot  what for   sevenspot  thats none of your business two   fivespot  yes it is his

alice   alice  here   king  what do you know about this business   alice  nothing whatever   king  to the jury  thats very important   white rabbit  unimportant your majesty means of course   king  unimportant of course i meant importantunimportantunimportant important consider your verdict  some of the jury write important and some write unimportant   white rabbit  theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty this paper has just been picked up   queen  whats in it   white rabbit  fumbles with a huge envelope  i havent opened it yet but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody   king  it must have been that unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know   alice  who is it directed to   white rabbit  it isnt directed at all in fact theres nothing written on the outside  takes out a tiny piece of paper  it isnt a letter at all its a set of verses   queen  are they in the prisoners handwriting  the jury brightens up   white rabbit  looks at the knaves hand knave hides his hand the chains rattle  no theyre not and thats the queerest thing about it  the jury looks puzzled   king  he must have imitated somebody elses hand   knave  please your majesty i didnt write it and they cant prove i did theres no name signed at the end   king  if you didnt sign it that only makes the matter worse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man  at this there is a general clapping of hands   queen  that proves his guilt   alice  it proves nothing of the sort why you dont even know what theyre about   king  read them   white rabbit  puts on his monocle  where shall i begin please your majesty   king  begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end then stop   white rabbit    they told me you had been to her     and mentioned me to him   she gave me a good character     but said i could not swim    i gave her one they gave him two     you gave us three or more   they all returned from him to you     though they were mine before    my notion was that you had been     before she had this fit   an obstacle that came between     him and ourselves and it    dont let him know she liked him best     for this must ever be   a secret kept from all the rest     between yourself and me   king  thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet so now let the jury   alice  if anyone of them can explain it ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it   jury  she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it   king  if theres no meaning in it that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know  spreads out the verses on his knee and studies them  i seem to see some meaning after all said i could not swim you cant swim can you   knave  shakes his head sadly and points to his suit  do i look like it   king  all right so far we know it to be true thats the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know   alice  but it goes on they all returned from him to you   king  triumphantly pointing to the tarts  why there they are nothing can be clearer than that then again before she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think   queen  never   king  then the words dont fit you  there is dead silence while the king looks around at the court with a smile   king  its a pun  everybody laughs music   king  let the jury consider their verdict   queen  no no sentence firstverdict afterwards   alice  stuff and nonsense   queen  furiously  hold your tongue   alice  i wont   queen  off with her head   alice  who cares for you   queen  cut it off   alice  youre nothing but a pack of cards  as lights go out and curtain falls all the characters hold their positions as if petrified  curtain   scene three  the curtain rises to show alice still asleep in the armchair the fire in the grate suffusing her with its glow   carroll  wake up alice it is time for tea  off stage the characters repeat their most characteristic lines off with her head consider your verdict oh my fur and whiskers the duchess sneezes the cat cries as if the characters were fading away into the pack of real playing cards which shower through the mirror all over alice there is music   alice  wakes rises and looks about in surprise and wonderment  whyit was a dream  curtain
